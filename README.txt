Collection of data strutures in some languages I know. Kyle Loundon's book is used as reference for C

----------------------------------building-------------------------------------

For C:

Each data structure-specific folder contains three C files: the
<datastructure>.c file, the <datastructure>.h file, and the
<datastrucutre>-test.c file. Compile with:

$ gcc <datastructures>.c <datastructure>-test.c

To get a test program for that data structure.

For anything else:

wait
